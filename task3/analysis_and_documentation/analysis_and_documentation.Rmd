```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
birds <- read_csv(here("clean_data/birds_cleaned.csv"))
```


For each question where we ask for bird names, give the birdâ€™s common name, scientific name and species abbreviation.

# 1. Which bird had the most individual sightings?

```{r}
birds %>% 
  select(species, count) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(n_sightings = n()) %>% 
  slice_max(n_sightings)
  
```
Short-tailed shearwater had 3610 individual sightings.


# 2. Which bird had the highest total count?
```{r}
birds %>% 
  select(species, count) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(sum_sightings = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice_max(sum_sightings)
```

Short-tailed shearwater was counted 982553 times.


# 3. Which bird had the highest total count above a latitude of -30?

```{r}
birds %>% 
  filter(lat > -30) %>% 
  select(species, count) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(sum_sightings = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice_max(sum_sightings)
```
The wedge-tailed shearwater had a total count of 855 above a lat of -30.


# 4. How many different types of birds were only ever seen in groups of 1?

```{r}
birds %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(count_max = max(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(count_max == 1) %>% 
  nrow()
```

163 different types of bird were only ever seen in groups of 1.

# 5. How many penguins were seen? (Hint: there are many types of penguin)

```{r}
birds %>% 
  select(species, count) %>%
  mutate(is_penguin = str_detect(species, "[Pp]enguin")) %>% 
  filter(is_penguin) %>% 
  summarise(n_penguins = sum(count, na.rm= TRUE))
```

158 penguins were seen.
